## Features

We want Phanbook to be the most powerful Q&A software out there, and we have a huge list of ideas that we want to
implement. It will take time, but Phanbook’s flexible plugin system will mean we can release early and often. Here’s a
snapshot of what we’ll be working on first:

- Multiple Themes
- Spam Blocking
- Markdown and rich text editing support
- Powerful search with Elasticsearch
- Single sign-on (Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Topic/Tags subscriptions and digest emails
- File attachments
- Post flagging/reporting and an intelligent auto-moderation system
- Rewards, badges, and gamification
- Q&A format and voting
- Simple CMS
- The modular structure with a convenient hierarchy that is based on namespaces

## Installation / Configuration

Please see the [installation][:install:] and [configuration][:config:] guides respectively.  

## Running the Application ##

You can run the application with either Apache, Nginx, or with the [built-in web server](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) feature of PHP.  The command would look something like: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8081 -t . .htrouter.php` The .htrouter file would then act like an .htaccess file.  Or you can run the application through Apache or Nginx.  

**Note that there are two .htaccess files in the application:**  
`/.htaccess` and `/public/.htaccess`.  
The web root should be `/` not `/public/` for this application. The .htaccess rewrites to public for you.
